## Use Cases 

Open Agents Builder is a very simple tool you can run on your own or use the [hosted version](https://openagentsbuilder.com). 

### E-commerce

You may list your products (with prices, variants, photos) and let the users configure and select what they're interested in. The agent will gather all required data, maintain the shopping cart and finalize with order!

### Made to Order, CPQ

Complex products are very difficult for users to configure. You may create an agent which is instructed how to configure the products based on even super-complex specs. Let it do the work for your users and for you - finalizing with a Quote or an Order!

### Booking

Use the Calendar module to let the users sign up for your services finding the most convinient time slots. Collect leads!

### Pre-visit inquiries

Share the link of the Agent with your patient/customers no matter if you are a medicine doctor either physio-terapist, trainer etc. The results will let you **save tons of time** preparing for the visit.

### Scheduling 

Tired of using **Calendly** or **Cal.com**? Send them the agent which will let the users schedule calls with you based on your availability + already scheduled events.

### Collecting user feedback

Add a widget to your website with a link to Agent which will ask 2-3 questions to get the users feedback, notify you on e-mail once they got it and store in a database for further analytics.

### NPS and e-NPS

Agent Doogle is great for checking the Net Promoter Score. Create an Agent, send a link to your employees (eNPS) or customers (NPS) - use the "Chat with the results" feature to calculate the NPS dynamically on the spot!

### Supporting users

Automatically answer all the users questions + use the event based actions to react for business critical situations (like potential lead etc)
